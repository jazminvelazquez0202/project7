		<p class="person-description"> A person I admire deeply would be my grandma, I admire her because she's a
		 strong person but most of all she's a strong mother who had to work as a single 
		 mother of six kids having no help from a man.<span class="important-point"> She raised six beautiful and kind 
			children all on her own and I'm pretty sure that could have not been simple.</span></p>
