	<h2 class="top-favorite" class="emphasis">A Person I admire <br> (past or present)</h2>
	
		<p>A person I admire deeply would be my grandma, I admire her because she's a
		 strong person but most of all she's a strong mother who had to work as a single 
		 mother of six kids having no help from a man. She raised six beautiful and kind 
		 children all on her own and I'm pretty sure that could have not been simple.</p>
